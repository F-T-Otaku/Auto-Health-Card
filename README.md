## Attention

1. Please edit your own cron table in report.yml.
2. Action's cron table runs in ***UTC***.

### How to create your own cron table

1. Open the xxx.yml fill. (Normally is "/.github/workflows/report.yml")
2. Change this to any time you want:
```
  schedule:
    - cron: "15 0 * * *"
    - cron: "20 1 * * *" 
    - cron: "25 6 * * *" 
    - cron: "30 7 * * *" 
```
3. `cron: "20 1 * * *" ` means it runs at 01:20 ***UTC*** every day.

   1. *P.S. UTC is eight hours later than CST.*
   2. *P.P.S. CST â€“ China Standard Time.*
   3. *P.P.P.S. To ensure the report is successful, please set more than 4 times.*
